## Difficulties Faced
When I first started the project, I was having trouble with the CSS updating in the browser everytime I updated the code. I finally decided to make separate HTML, CSS, and 
JS files separate from flask and work on the functionality of my project there. Once I had what I wanted, I copied the code back into the project files. 

I was having trouble deciding whether I should use JavaScript or Flask for the core of my project. First I tried Flask, but I realized that I wouldn't be able to do it with 
Flask and instead used JavaScript.

## Things I enjoyed
I really like learning JavaScript and Flask. JavaScript is similar to Python in many ways. If statements, for loops, functions, etc are all the same but with different syntax. 
I did sometimes forget to add the colon at the end of the lines. Learning to use Flask was also interesting.
